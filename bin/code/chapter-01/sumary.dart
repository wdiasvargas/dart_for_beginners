// Numbers, strings, and Booleans—they are all literals in Dart. Consider these literals: 1, 2.3, "Some Strings", true, false.We need to remember a few things, such as the following:var isValid = true;• var is the data type.• isValid is the variable name (or spot in memory).• true is a literal.You can mention the data type of a variable as int, double, String, or bool. If you don’t, you can simply refer to them as var. In that case, when it’s not mentioned, the data type is inferred.String interpolation is a good practice. Don’t use the + sign to add two strings.Use an expression for operators, such as ${number1 + number2}.What will be your choice? final or const? It is a difficult choice. You need to remember a few things: when you choose final, it is initialized, and when it is accessed, the memory is allocated for it. The const is implicitly final; this means when it is compiled, it is initialized, and the memory is allocated for it.
